In case of problems booting with the included kernel in BionicDog, this (older) kernel 4.4.0 can be used.
Extract the contents of "00-kernel-4.4.0-124_amd64.tar.gz" in the casper directory and reboot.
The files: vmlinuz and initrd1.xz need to be overwritten.
(better make backup of these files first).
