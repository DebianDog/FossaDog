FossaDog is very small Ubuntu Live CD
It is made to be small and look like Puppy linux with similar tools and options,
without changing anything in Ubuntu structure.

Boot code examples (grub(4dos) after extracting /casper folder from the iso on top of sda1:

==========================================================================================

- FossaDog 'boot style Porteus' :

Ubuntu Live CD using porteus boot method (very similar to Puppy linux boot and save options).

It is not the exact Porteus boot method since it uses .squashfs modules extention instead .xzm
and /casper instead /porteus folder, but the save file options are the same as in Porteus.
You can skip from=/ in the kernel boot line but it is better to keep it this way.
For example if folder /casper is inside folder /bionic you need to use from=/bionic/

This will create automatically /casper/changes folder for changes: 

Code:
title FossaDog (sda1) 
root (hd0,0) 
kernel /casper/vmlinuz noauto from=/ changes=/casper/
initrd /casper/initrd1.xz


This need to be created "changes.dat" (or whatever custom name) savefile first for saving changes: 

Code:
title FossaDog (sda1) 
root (hd0,0) 
kernel /casper/vmlinuz noauto from=/ changes=/casper/changes.dat 
initrd /casper/initrd1.xz


This way of saving changes is equivalent of "pupmode=13" in puppy , saving changes only at shutdown: 

Code:
title FossaDog save on exit (sda1) 
root (hd0,0) 
kernel /casper/vmlinuz noauto from=/ changes=EXIT:/casper/changes.dat 
initrd /casper/initrd1.xz


Note for last example: there will be prompt for save or not to save. Also for prompt to create savefile first time boot. 

Like the previous one saving changes only at shutdown but in folder changes:

Code:
title FossaDog save on exit (sda1) 
root (hd0,0)
kernel /casper/vmlinuz noauto from=/ changes=EXIT:/casper/
initrd /casper/initrd1.xz

Recommended to put the casper folder in a folder with unique name, e.g. Fossa_Dog, then use this:

Code:
title FossaDog in folder Fossa_Dog, save on exit (sda1) 
root (hd0,0)
kernel /Fossa_Dog/casper/vmlinuz noauto from=/Fossa_Dog changes=EXIT:/Fossa_Dog/casper/
initrd /Fossa_Dog/casper/initrd1.xz

Porteus-boot code does not need anything special added for encrypted save file.
